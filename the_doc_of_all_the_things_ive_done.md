# What I did here:

Here is a list of all the things I did
## Timeline:
### A short overview/timeline.

#### Weeks 1-3:

1. Reviewed two PR's of Akiva's to learn how the Civis platform works and get a feel for the `api_syncs` code.
2. 1st commit Bug Fix: watermark conflict. When tow syncs try to access/edit the watermark table at the same time, Redshift errors (this is for the sake of data consistency, Redshift is seemingly a lot more regid with transactions than other analytics database solutions??). Merged the next day after PR was review. Short PR so no requests for changes were made.
3. Asked to think about and fill out a document discussing how I would like to be managed and the structure of our 1-1s.
4. Started my first addition to the `api_syncs` repo. Building out a sync between NGP and Mobile Commons that would eventually be striked and turned into Actblue to Mobile Commons. I started with the NGP class scructure that used a restructed view of NGP data. More explanation will be given.
5. Reworking a sql script to flag donors for refunds because we weren't excepting donations from lobbyists and employees various companies, etc.

#### Weeks 4-6
